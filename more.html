 <p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Why it's on the list:</span></strong></em> Ever done a set of max-rep chins? Then you know the biceps are working seriously hard during this move. Both pull-ups (overhand grip) and chin-ups (underhand grip) have a high degree of elbow flexion, but research has shown that chin-ups work the biceps significantly more.</p>
  <p>Sets of 8-12 reps too easy? Add weight. Too hard? Use assistance. Too uncomfortable on your wrists or elbows? Alternate with a neutral (palms facing in) or cambered grip, or perform them on rings. Grip giving out? Wear wrist straps.</p>
 <p><strong>Chin-up Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong></p>
 <ul>
 <li>Standard chin-up</li>
 <li>Machine-assisted chin-up</li>
 <li>Band-assisted chin-up</li>
 <li>L-sit chin-up</li>
 </ul>
 <p><em><strong>In your workout:</strong></em> If you train back with biceps, this exercise could make a great bridge movement between the two body parts for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.</p>

                        <p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Why it's on the list:</span></strong></em> Some lifters speak reverently of the bent-over row as the fourth powerlift." Whether you agree or not, this is a back-focused movement in which you can go very heavy, and with the reverse grip, the biceps are heavily engaged. It's not really the kind of exercise you'd do on a biceps-only day, so it makes a good bridge between back and biceps.</p>

<p><strong>Row Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse-grip bent-over row</li>
<li>Cable seated row (underhand grip)</li>
<li>Incline dumbbell row (underhand grip)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In your workout</strong></em> Include it in your back routine, or as a bridge exercise when training back and biceps together. Go fairly heavy and train in the classic muscle-building rep range of 8-12 reps.</p>

                        <p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Why it's on the list</span></strong><strong>:</strong></em> Curls with a palms-facing or neutral grip do more than just hit the biceps, they also heavily recruit the brachialis, a muscle that doesn't get measured on EMG studies because it's beneath the biceps. Because it's not as obvious a move as, say, a barbell curl, it often gets undeservedly skipped on arm day.</p>
<p>Why should you care? Increasing the girth of the brachialis can "raise" your biceps from below, making your entire arm larger. Another reason: They were Chris Hemsworth's go-to curl to transform into Thor.</p>
<p>Pro tip: The dumbbell version is solid, but even better is the cable version holding a rope grip, because it gives you constant tension throughout the range of motion.</p>
<p><strong>Hammer Curl Variations for Biceps Growth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cable rope hammer curl</li>
<li>Dumbbell hammer curl</li>
<li>Cable rope preacher hammer curl</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In your workout:</strong></em> Hammer curls are usually done in the middle or at the end of a workout in a classic rep range of 8-12 reps. Experiment with isometric holds to create a deep burn that even the pros fear.</p>

                        <p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Why it made the list:</span></strong></em> What's the difference between curling at 90 degrees and 45? More than you think. The incline curl elongates the biceps and increases the stretch at the start of the movement. Theoretically, this helps you target the long head and build the so-called biceps peak."</p>

<p><strong>Incline Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Incline dumbbell curl </li>
<li>Palms-out incline curl</li>
<li>Incline hammer curl</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In your workout:</strong></em> This is detail work, not the main course! Perform these after an exercise like standing curls, in which both biceps heads are targeted with heavy weight. Because of the "overstretched" arm position at the bottom of the movement, it's best done with relatively light weights and at least 8-12 reps per set.</p>

                        <p><em><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Why it's on the list:</span></strong></em> Hey, there's a reason the concentration curl fares so well on muscle-activation studies. One reason is that the torso position limits shoulder involvement, but another might be the mind-muscle connection many people report experiencing with this move. There is actually some emerging evidence surrounding the ability of the mind-muscle connection to help increase muscle growth.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration Curl Variations for Biceps Growth:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Concentration curl </li>
<li>Close-grip concentration cur</li>
<li>Cable concentration cur</li>
<li>Band concentration cur</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In your workout:</strong></em> This is best treated as a light, strict move to finish off your biceps when you're already somewhat fatigued. Pick a weight just heavy enough that you're failing around 10-12 reps.</p>
